SGI 3000 L1 CONTROLLER USB DRIVER SOURCE PACKAGE
------------------------------------------------

* OVERVIEW *

This package contains the source for the USB loadable driver that is used
when connecting an L3 controller (i.e. SGI 230 PC running Linux) directly
to an SGI 3000 Series system via USB (without an L2 Controller).

Before attempting to build this driver directly, you should be aware
that there are RPM packages available for many SGI "supported" kernels
and standard RedHat release kernels (for Linux kernel version 2.4.2
and beyond).  These drivers are contained on the SGI Origin 3000 Series
L3 Controller CD-ROM (versions 1.5 and beyond), and the Internal Support
Tools CD (versions 2.5.1 and beyond).  They are also available for
download from Engineering Diagnostics and Software's Diagnostic Software
Patches (internal) web site:

    http://wwweng.americas.sgi.com/PUBLIC/diags/release/patches/

The driver RPM names all begin with "kernel_sgisn1_usb", followed by
the revision of the supported kernel (as reported by the "uname -r" command).

If you are running a Linux kernel version that is released and supported
by SGI, or is a released RedHat kernel, and it is version 2.4.2 or later,
send email to esd@postofc.corp.sgi.com and we will look into creating a
pre-built driver package for your kernel.



* BUILDING AND INSTALLING THE DRIVER *

In order to build the driver, you need have the kernel source and include
files (provided by the "kernel-source-<kernel version>" RPM) for the
running kernel installed on the machine.  The kernel source is installed
at /usr/src/linux-<kernel version> when the RPM is installed.

To build the driver, install it, and load it automatically (along with 
creating the /dev/sgil1* devices required by the driver), just run
"make" (as root) in the directory where sgil1.c, sgil1.h and Makefile are
located.  If the header files for your kernel are not in
/usr/src/linux-2.4/include, then you need to set the SYSINCLUDES macro:

    # make SYSINCLUDES=-I/usr/src/linux-<kernel version>/include

(notice that the path must be prepended with "-I").  This will build the
driver, install it, install the startup script /etc/rc.d/init.d/sgil1,
and run that startup script.  The /etc/rc.d/init.d/sgil1 script is
run at boot-time to insure that the /dev/sgil1* device nodes exist and that
the sgil1.o driver is loaded into the kernel.

If you have problems building and/or installing this driver, you can send
email to esd@postofc.corp.sgi.com along with a detailed description of
the problem (all of the output generated when running "make") and 
the kernel version that you are running.
